		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Selam is a social media platform that was inspired by the need for a peaceful and respectful online community. As an ALX student i developed this project as a part of my portfolio. I believe that social media should be a place where people can connect and share ideas without fear of harassment or negativity.</p>
